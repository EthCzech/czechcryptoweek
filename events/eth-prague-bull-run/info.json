  "description": "Still waiting for the charts to move? Move your legs instead. Block by block. Step by step. Gas up IRL. A literal 5K run to kickstart ETH Prague with real GMs and bullish energy.\n\nWhat's Going Down:\n\n*   5K social run through the heart of Prague.\n*   Pace: somewhere between degen sprint and validator slow sync.\n*   Start time: 7:30 AM sharp — because the real ones wake up bullish.\n*   No talks, no booths — just real conversation while moving.\n*   End at a local café for coffee, croissants, and quality hangs.\n*   Can't run? Meet us at the café. Same bullish energy, fewer steps.\n\nVibe:\n\n*   Proper GM energy while the city's still booting up.\n*   Meet degens, devs, and founders who actually ship (or run).\n*   No stage, no agenda — just pace and presence.\n*   Zero gas, all gains.",
