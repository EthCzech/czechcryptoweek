We're bringing together institutions, ecosystem operators, and infrastructure teams for an off-the-record morning of sharp roundtables, meaningful chats, and focused networking â€” all with a builder-first mindset. Coffee, not panels. Real use cases, not hypotheticals. This is where next-gen institutional blockchain adoption gets dissected.",
