  "description": "**Alternative Currencies Breakfast, hosted by Circles @ ETHPrague**\n\nBitcoin promised to be a new censorship resistant form of money, but it turned out to be a store of value rather than a medium of exchange.\n\nWe're hosting a breakfast for those working on, and those interested in learning more about newer forms of money that are better and fairer.\n\nJoin us for a cozy breakfast gathering to discuss these topics with like-minded folks over coffee and good food.\n\nAll attendees will get a chance to be one of the first ones to be onboarded to Circles, a new fairer form of money launched on 21st May 2025, right on the spot.\n\nOur co-founder **Friederike Ernst** will also be joining us - if you watched her talk the day before (or even if you missed it), come meet her in person and continue the conversation.\n\nMore about us: www.aboutcircles.com",
