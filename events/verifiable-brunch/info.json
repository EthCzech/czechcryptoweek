  "description": "Pull up for a brunch gathering with builders, founders, and funders pushing the frontier of verifiability in Web3.\n\nVerifiable Brunch with vlayer brings together hackathon teams, early-stage founders, protocol devs, and ecosystem explorers working on governance, identity, data infra, and zero-knowledge tooling. If you're thinking in attestations, proofs, and modular coordination—this is your space.\n\nOur agenda mirrors the lifecycle of a verifiable project:\n\n* Build → Launch fast with composable tools\n* Grow → Activate your first believers and contributors\n* Raise → Navigate the path to capital in modular, infra-first ecosystems\n\nExpect hands-on sessions, no-fluff convos, and quality brunch vibes with a community of on-chain builders.",
